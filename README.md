I'm a junior software developer learning everything I can about Flutter ðŸ’™. I started as a manual software tester and moved into automated software tester to junior developer in my current job. I couldn't be much happier. 


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal App

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning more Flutter. Everything I can learn I will.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Flutter. Currently enjoying Andrea Course and tips and tricks.

âš¡ Fun fact: I love learning. If I don't learn a new thing every once in a while I am wasting my time.
