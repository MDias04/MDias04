I'm a junior software developer learning everything I can about Flutter ğŸ’™. I started as a manual software tester and moved from an automated software tester to a junior developer in my current job. I couldn't be more happier. 


ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m always working on something.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning and enjoying Flutter every day.

âš¡ Fact: I love learning, building new stuff and gaming.
