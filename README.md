I'm a junior software developer learning everything I can about Flutter ğŸ’™. I began my career as a manual software tester, transitioned to automated testing, and now I'm thriving as a junior developer. I couldn't be happier.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m always working on something.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning and enjoying Flutter every day.

âš¡ Fact: I love learning, building new stuff and gaming.
